## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Plugin and marketplace manifests.
- Checklists for transaction boundaries, races, idempotency and money arithmetic.
- `money-reviewer` and `money-verifier` agents and the report JSON Schema.
- Triage without a model: changes that do not touch money are not sent to Claude.
- `/money-review:money-review` skill: review the current branch against its base.
- `bin/money-review` for shell use: refuses to run with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, never
  starts Claude for a change without money, prints Markdown or JSON, `--fail-on` exit
  code.
